What if there is a function called getCurrentUser in discord?
And what if the function returns a user object that has a premiumType attribute.
Exactly, you inject JavaScript and change the value, so you can stream at 1440p.

# ✍ Usage

First you need Python. The tool was made in Python 3.8 so ... I would recommend that version to you. Then you only need
the Discord Desktop application. That's it, the project has no dependencies.

Just navigate to the Python script and run main.py.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You need to start discord first!

```shell
cd <path/to/<script>
python main.py
```
