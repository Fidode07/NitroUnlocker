What if there is a function called getCurrentUser in discord?
And what if the function returns a user object that has a premiumType attribute.
Exactly, you inject JavaScript and change the value, so you can stream at 1440p.

# ✍ Usage 

First of all, you need Python. The tool was developed in Python 3.8 so ...
I recommend this version of Python. Then just navigate to the script and run main.py.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You may start discord first!

```shell
cd <path/to/<script>
python main.py
```
